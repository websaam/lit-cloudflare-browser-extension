# Lit-CloudFlare plugin

This plugin is created with the intention of eliminating the steps in which CloudFlare user 
interacts with the lit-protocol. CloudFlare users would able to token-gate their videos right in the 
CloudFlare dashboard, without the need to go through third-party websites/apps.
